# Backpack CSS

## Where's the CSS?!
All Backpack CSS is compiled from LESS using [less-middleware][] to
take advantage of compilation and minification. Check `/static/less`
and you'll find what you're looking for.

## Badgetastic & Bootstrap
The Backpack styles build on [Twitter Bootstrap][] to make page building
quick(er) and painless(er). Check out `/static/examples/badgetastic/test.hml`
and `/static/examples/badgetastic/test-full.html` to see examples of
the full skin. Always make sure your style changes don't destroy those
pages as well.
